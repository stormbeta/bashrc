# Usage:
# 1. loopit FILES 'shell commands as string literal'
#    NOTE: It's very important that the command string be completely quoted as the last arg
#
# 2. loopit FILES -- shell commands
#
# 3. loopit FILENAME
#    NOTE: Only suitable for watching a single file that can be ran as ./FILENAME
#
# e.g. to watch a whole directory:
#    loopit directory/** 'echo "It changed!"'

if [[ "$#" -eq 1 ]]; then
  set -- "$@" "$(realpath "$1")"
fi

files=()
while [[ "$1" != "--" ]] && [[ "$#" -ne 1 ]]; do
  files+=("$1")
  shift 1
done

# NOTE: -o is required to workaround issues with some utilities that
#       behave strangely in the presence of stdin not being a tty
